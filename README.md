To do list

This will be a to do list written in pure JS (if possible - I do not know jQuery and other tools yet)

FEATURES:
- ability to create numerous lists to categorize the tasks with their deadlines
- "Upcoming" list showing the upcoming tasks that need to be performed
- colors to determine tasks' urgency
  a. red - needs to be done exactly on the day scheduled
  b. yellow - needs to be done some time approximate to the scheduled date
  c. blue - has no deadline but it is the user's choice to perform the task on the given date
- calendar showing an overview of tasks scheduled this week/month
- ideally, an Android application sending notfications about upcoming tasks and tasks to be performed on the current day

That's it for now, I guess :)
